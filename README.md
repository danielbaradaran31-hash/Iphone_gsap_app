🚀 MacBook 3D Interactive Showcase
An immersive 3D product experience built with React, Three.js, React Three Fiber, and GSAP.
This project brings a MacBook Pro to life with smooth animations, dynamic materials, and full user interaction — all rendered directly in the browser.

✨ Features
🎨 Dynamic Color Customization
Users can switch between different MacBook body colors. Materials update in real time using Three.js and Zustand.

💻 Model Size Switching (14" / 16")
Two high‑detail 3D models with seamless transitions powered by GSAP (fade, slide, and opacity animations).

🌀 Full 3D Interaction
Rotate and explore the model using PresentationControls from Drei.
Smooth, intuitive, and mobile‑friendly.

⚡ GSAP‑Powered Animations
All transitions — model switching, fading, movement — are animated with GSAP for a premium, Apple‑like feel.

📱 Fully Responsive
Optimized scaling and interaction for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
